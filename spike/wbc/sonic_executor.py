"""GEAR-SONIC behind the `BodyCommand` contract.

Lives on the spike side because it needs numpy + onnxruntime + mujoco, while
`superbot/` stays standard-library only. Phase 3 promotes it once the join
works; until then this is the measured adapter, not product code.

The executor owns feasibility: it clamps, solves, and reports what MuJoCo
actually achieved. It never reports what it was asked for.

Measured facts this file is built on (`research/c3m-results.md`,
`research/sonic-gate-results.md`, `research/wbc-policy-proposal.md`):

- Hold is **not** "freeze the current clip". It switches to the standing clip
  `squat_001__A359` frame 0 and freezes the *anchor index* (`freeze=0`), so the
  encoder's 10-frame lookahead never contains walking. Measured hold RMS
  1.3e-4 m/s. Freezing the wrong thing drifted 0.23-2.07 m.
- Wrist aims straight ahead track to 3.51 cm / 7.22 deg; 30 deg off-axis is
  8.63 cm / 28.33 deg. The body must turn to face a target, not aim sideways.
- Arm override *during* walking is not supported by this controller. Only a
  wrist-orientation-only refinement survives (7.22 -> 5.08 deg); the QP joint
  override is dead.

`vr_delta` is a 9-vector (head, left wrist, right wrist - each xyz) added to
the clip's own targets; `vr_orn_delta` is three quats left-multiplied onto
them. That is the only per-tick steering this controller exposes.
