"""Wrist -> pixel, through the camera we ourselves are telling the game to use.

This is the arithmetic that makes a slow brain sufficient. We emit the HMD pose,
so the camera is not an unknown we must estimate: a wrist from `mjData` and a
pixel named by a writer become comparable with a pinhole projection. No detector,
no depth, no 3D reconstruction.

Two facts this module depends on, both worth stating because they are easy to
break later:

1. **The root cancels.** `BodyState.head` and the wrist poses are all root-relative,
   so the projection subtracts one root-relative point from another. Composing the
   root first is not merely unnecessary, it would reintroduce the ordering trap
   that already cost a session (`root_q` is `(w, x, y, z)`, not `(x, y, z, w)`).
2. **The FOV is an input, not a constant.** `wire.fill` sets `per_view_data_valid =
   False` and writes no FOV, so the compositor's live field of view is currently
   unknown here. Tests pass a fixture; production code must pass a measured value.
   Inventing a default would make every projection a consistent lie.

Frame conventions. Positions are MuJoCo's Z-up frame with +X forward, so in the
head's own frame the gaze is +X, up is +Z, and the robot's left is +Y. The output
is normalised to the HMD view, origin top-left, matching `superbot.intent/1`.
