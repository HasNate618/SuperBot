"""The `superbot.intent/1` contract: what a writer is allowed to ask for.

This schema exists to keep one boundary honest. A writer - the hub script, an
operator click, or a later model - names **a skill, a side, and optionally a
pixel**. It does not name joint angles, an OpenXR pose, or a world-space point
for the hand. Turning an intent into `BodyCommand`s is the adapter's job, and the
body never learns that Superhot or a pixel exists.

Why a separate schema instead of a field on `BodyCommand`: pixels are not
robotics state. Every existing consumer of `superbot.body/1` (executor, relay,
dashboard, tests) would have to learn about an image coordinate it can never use,
and the contract's "authority is a bitmask, unset fields are ignored" would gain
a field no authority bit can gate.

Two things this schema deliberately does **not** carry:

- A 3D point for the target. Design §9 keeps 2D->3D out: a pixel is a ray, and
  the glow closes the depth.
- A grab on glow. Glow true means "in range now"; closing the hand is its own
  intent, because an automatic grab on a false highlight would take the wrong
  object.
